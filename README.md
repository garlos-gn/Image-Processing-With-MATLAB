# Image Processing With MATLAB

This repository is a mix of 2 different projects: editing images in the space and frequency domain and segmenting images in order to obtain the amount of coins in the photo.

1. In the "Image preprocessing" folder, we find just one script, which consists of using MATLAB functions in order to:
- Crop images
- Improving visualization
- Applying different LPF in order to smooth the image
- Applying HPF to improve the details of the image
- Joining information from different canals
- Characterization and noise removal
- Pattern detection

2. In the "Image segmentation" folder, there's two different MATLAB scripts that segmentates different coin images by using mathematical morphology
- In the "segmentation.m" script different segmentation techniques are studied, and finally it is chosen one implementation.
